## Changes
I needed to customize pendingViewHolder -because i use StaggeredGridLayoutManager and i need pendingViews to use fullSpan so in viewHolder i do so. In order to have this happened, i need to create my own view then pass it to the library, so i made that part little bit more flexible.

And also realised that it should not call notifyDataSetChanged everytime, since we have the ability to notify specific portions now. So i made it optional, up to flag.

Finally, since we receive parent object from adapter when it calls onCreateViewHolder, we don't actually need to pass context into this adapter just to create pendingView.

## rv-adapter-endless

`EndlessRecyclerViewAdapter` support for RecyclerView.Adapter

## Installation

```groovy
compile 'com.rockerhieu:rv-adapter-endless:<latest-version>'
```

## Usage

To use `EndlessRecyclerViewAdapter` you need to create a subclass that will control the endlessness, specifying what `View` to use for the loading placeholder.

When the loading view is shown, it will send a request to load more data via the interface `RequestToLoadMoreListener`. After loading the data, you can let the adapter know via `onDataReady()` method.

```java
OriginalAdapter adapter = new OriginalAdapter();
EndlessRecyclerViewAdapter endlessRecyclerViewAdapter = new EndlessRecyclerViewAdapter(this, adapter, new RequestToLoadMoreListener() {
   @Override
   public void onLoadMoreRequested() {
      loadMoreData(new OnSuccess() {
        void onSuccess(List<Item> items) {
          adapter.append(items);
          // notify that the data is ready, and the adapter SHOULD continue to load more
          endlessRecyclerViewAdapter.onDataReady(true);
        }
      }, new OnError() {
        void onError() {
          // notify that the data is ready, and the adapter SHOULD NOT continue to load more
          endlessRecyclerViewAdapter.onDataReady(false);
        }
      )
   }
});
rv.setAdapter(endlessRecyclerViewAdapter);
```

You can have a look at the example project for more details.
